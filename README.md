# Multithreaded-Bot
Want to make a project that requires multithreading? This script can generate as many tasks as you want, to do the same process simultaneously. This can be used for page monitors, automated checkout systems, form filling and more! 

The code, csv file and txt file can all be adapted to do differnt things. The current script is a framework made for an automated request bot made to purchase things without ever having to open your webbrowser. Just add the relevent requests under the def tasks(): . As I said it can be easily adapted to do various other things.

For this script to work all the feilds in the csv file and txt file must be filled out for the print and logging statements to execute

If you use this script please let me know by messaging my discord Khushthedev#9679 or star this repo.
